API to build dynamic actions on runtimeand have the possibility to get notified for each and every change, that happens to any particular action.e.g. Title change, icon change, disabled state, etc.\n\nGetting started\nStep 1: Install ng-action-outlet\nYou can use either npm or yarn command-line tool.Choose the tool that is appropriate for your project.\nNPM\nnpm install @ng-action-outlet/core\nYARN\nyarn add @ng-action-outlet/core\nStep 2: Import ActionOutletModule\nImport Action Outlet NgModule to your Angular module\nimport { ActionOutletModule } from '@ng-action-outlet/core';\n\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  imports: [ActionOutletModule],\n  ...\n})\nexport class ExampleModule { }Step 3: Define what component to use with what action\nUse providers to set default components for each action to be used for rendering.Provide action class and use value pointing to your component class,\nso that action outlet can associate component to provided action.\nimport { ActionOutletModule, ActionButton, ActionGroup, ActionToggle } from '@ng-action-outlet/core';\n\nimport { ExampleButtonComponent } from './example-button.component';\nimport { ExampleGroupComponent } from './example-group.component';\nimport { ExampleToggleComponent } from './example-toggle.component';\n\n@NgModule({\n  ...\n  imports: [ActionOutletModule],\n  providers: [{\n      provide: ActionButton,\n      useValue: ExampleButtonComponent\n  }, {\n      provide: ActionGroup,\n      useValue: ExampleGroupComponent\n  }, {\n      provide: ActionToggle,\n      useValue: ExampleToggleComponent\n  }]\n  ...\n})\nexport class ExampleModule { }Step 4: Override default's in your component\nIn order to override your default settings, do the same as initially in a module,but only for actions that you actually wish to change.\nimport { ActionToggle } from '@ng-action-outlet/core';\n\nimport { ExampleCheckboxComponent } from './example-checkbox.component';\n\n@Component({\n  ...\n  providers: [{\n      provide: ActionToggle,\n      useValue: ExampleCheckboxComponent\n  }]\n  ...\n})\nexport class ExampleComponent { }Step 5: Create action instances\nCreate actions in a component class so that they can be accessed from the template.\nimport { ActionOutletFactory } from '@ng-action-outlet/core';\n\n@Component(...)\nexport class ExampleComponent implements OnInit {\n    ...\n    group: ActionGroup;\n\n    constructor(private actionOutlet: ActionOutletFactory) { }\n\n    ngOnInit() {\n        this.group = this.actionOutlet.createGroup();\n        this.group.createToggle()\n          .setTitle('Example title')\n          .check();\n    }\n    ...\n}Step 6: Render the actions\nBind created actions to actionOutlet renderer directive.\nAvailable actions\n\nActionButton\nActionGroup\nActionToggle\n\nIn order to create custom action class, refer to ActionAbstract class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
